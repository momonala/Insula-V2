VERSION CONTROL 

12/13/16 7:25pm

integrated old EMG and breath rate processing (have not tested emg)
reduced delay value to 40ms (low sample rate does not seem to affect BMP algo)
currently prints booleans of pulse detection and breath I/O

12/13/16
updated breath rate algorithm to run at faster sample rate (100Hz)
happy with percision of breath and pulse, still no emg
