#Insula 
Insula is a wearable device that translates physiological events from sensor data (EEG, ECG, EMG, breath rate, hand gestures) into music in real-time. A heart beat turns into a drum beat, the rise and fall of a breath turns into the tension and release of a chord progression, etc. Here you can find the code that runs under the hood. 

The goal of Insula is to make biodata interesting, meaningful and useful to a diverse set of users. Our technology allows users to become mindful of the processes in their bodies through the universal medium of music. We have created all custom hardware and software for the device, building on platforms including Arduino, ChucK, OpenBCI and Processing. 

I’ve separated Insula into two components: biological (v1), and tactile (v2). V1 consists of the electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and breath rate sensors, all of which were part of the original thesis project that started Insula. V2 is a new component that introduces flex sensors on each finger and an accelerometer for more intentional control of the music. EEG processing, which ran on OpenBCI cannot be found here, but it was part of the original V1. Message me if you’re interested on that.

##Insula V1
###Components:
1. Flex Sensor

2. Acclerometer

##Conclusion: 
The name Insula comes from the insular cortex of the brain, which is responsible for helping us recognize our own biology. Your insula is what allows you to feel your heartbeat echo through your body when you’re excited, and what makes your feel thirsty after a long run. And that’s why Insula was built: as an avenue to recognize, respond to, and think more creatively and holistically about our own biology.
